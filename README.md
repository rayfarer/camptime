## What is this?
An EverQuest mob timer and (un)luckiness meter.

## But why?
Mostly just for fun. I frequently settle in for long camps where I am semi-AFK and want to be notified when the mob I'm camping is scheduled to reappear. I started building a [Python script](https://github.com/rayfarer/eq-scripts/tree/master/camptime) and realized a GUI tool would be more fun and maybe other people would use it.

## How did you build this?
Frontend: React (Vite)
Backend: Firebase Firestore, Storage, Cloud Functions and Auth. The EverQuest loot tables and all other data is stored in a SQL AWS RDS.

## Can I contribute?
Absolutely. I plan on hosting the site soon, but any PRs are welcome. I sometimes live stream code sessions on Twitch.
